    "Julia is built around types. Software architectures in Julia are built around good use of the type system. This makes it easy to build generic code which works over a large range of types and gets good performance. The result is high-performance code that has many features. In fact, with generic typing, your code may have more features than you know of! The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the multiple dispatch designs that allow this to happen."

    "## Duck Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "If it quacks like a duck, it might as well be a duck. This is the idea of defining an object by the way that it acts. This idea is central to type-based designs: **abstract types are defined by how they act**. For example, a `Number` is some type that can do things like `+`,`-`,`*`, and `/`. In this category we have things like `Float64` and `Int32`. An `AbstractFloat` is some floating point number, and so it should have a dispatch of `eps(T)` that gives its machine epsilon. An `AbstractArray` is a type that can be indexed like `A[i]`. An `AbstractArray` may be mutable, meaning it can be \"set\": `A[i]=v`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These abstract types then have actions which abstract from their underlying implmentation. `A.*B` does element-wise multiplication, and in many cases it does not matter what kind of array this is done on. The default is `Array` which is a contiguous array on the CPU, but this action is common amongst `AbstractArray` types. If a user has a `DistributedArray` (`DArray`), then `A.*B` will work on multiple nodes of a cluster. If the user uses a `GPUArray`, then `A.*B` will be performed on the GPU. Thus, if you don't restrict the usage of your algorithm to `Array`, then your algorithm actually is \"just works\" as many different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all well and good, but this would not be worthwhile if it was not performant. Thankfully, Julia has an answer to this. Every function auto-specializes on the types which it is given. Thus if you look at something like:"

Of course, at the \"very bottom\" our algorithms have to use the fields of the types, but the full interface can then be built up using a simple set of functions which in many cases with replace runtime data with constants."

For example, we can, using dispatch, create a `WeirdStudent` which does not like music, and that will still be compile-time information which is fully optimized. This means that these small functions which have constant return values allow for compile-time inheritance of behavior, and these traits don't have to be tied to abstract types (all of our examples were on `AbstracPerson`, but we could've said a `GPUArray` likes music if we felt like it!).

Honestly, if something ever gets added to Julia's Base library for this, it will likely look very similar, and the only real difference to the user will be that the compiler will directly recognize the keywords, meaning you would use base and extend instead of `@base` and `@extend`. So if you have something that really really really needs inheritance, go for it: there's no downsides to using a package + macro for this.

    "Programming for type systems has a different architecture than object-oriented systems. Instead of being oriented around the objects and their fields, type-dispatch systems are oriented around the actions of types. Using traits, multiple inheritance behavior can be given. Using this structure, the compiler can have maximal information, and use this to optimize the code. But also, this directly generalizes the vast majority of the code to not be \"implementation-dependent\", allowing for duck-typed code to be fully performance, with all of the details handled by dispatch/traits/abstract types. The end result is flexible, generic, and high performance code."
